ðŸ§± Wall-Detecting Robot (C Simulation)
This project simulates a simple robot using an ultrasonic sensor to detect a wall and take basic actions based on the measured distance. It is implemented in the C programming language.

ðŸ“Œ Description
The robot receives distance input from a simulated ultrasonic sensor:

If the distance is less than 10.00 cm â†’ it prints:
"Distance: [value]!!! Turn back"

If the distance is 10.00 cm or more â†’ it prints:
"Distance: [value]!!! Keep going"

The simulation runs in an infinite loop, generating new sensor values every 3 seconds.
